# Load frequency control in RTDS

This project implements the secondary control of a power grid simulated in RTDS.
Python module communicates with RTDS via TCP sockets. 

## Motivation

In power grids, frequency is an indicator of the balance between load and demand. Any frequency deviation from its nominal (normally 50 or 60 Hz) means that there is an imbalance between generation and consumption. This deviation causes heavy damage to the power grid, if it is not regulated in time. For this reason, power systems are equipped with the following controls:

- **Primary control**:
- **Secondary control**:
